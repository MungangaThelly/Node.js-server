# Node.js-server
en Node.js-server och koppla den till en MongoDB-databas


Project Name
This is a Node.js Express application that uses environment variables, handles authentication, connects to a database, and provides CRUD operations for items.

Features
Environment Variables: Uses .env file to manage sensitive data and configuration.
Express Server: A simple REST API server built with Express.
CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled for handling requests from different origins.
Content Security Policy (CSP): Adds security headers to restrict resources from untrusted sources.
Authentication: Provides login functionality.
CRUD for Items: Offers basic routes for item-related operations.
Database: Connects to a MongoDB database (or any DB you choose by updating the connection).
Requirements
Node.js: v14 or higher
MongoDB (or any database you're using)
.env file to store environment variables securely
Installation
1. Clone the repository
bash
Kopiera kod
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
2. Install dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the required packages.

bash
Kopiera kod
cd your-repository
npm install
3. Setup .env file
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your environment variables. Example:

env
Kopiera kod
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
4. Run the application
Start the server by running:

Summary:
This code sets up a backend API server using Express with the following features:

Loads environment variables from a .env file.
Uses middleware for CORS and body parsing.
Sets a Content Security Policy (CSP) for enhanced security.
Defines routes for handling authentication, items, and users.
Connects to a database.
Starts a server on a specified port.
It's a typical setup for an Express app that needs authentication, database integration, and RESTful API routing.
