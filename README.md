# Node.js-server
en Node.js-server och koppla den till en MongoDB-databas


Project Name
This is a Node.js Express application that uses environment variables, handles authentication, connects to a database, and provides CRUD operations for items.

Features
Environment Variables: Uses .env file to manage sensitive data and configuration.
Express Server: A simple REST API server built with Express.
CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled for handling requests from different origins.
Content Security Policy (CSP): Adds security headers to restrict resources from untrusted sources.
Authentication: Provides login functionality.
CRUD for Items: Offers basic routes for item-related operations.
Database: Connects to a MongoDB database (or any DB you choose by updating the connection).
Requirements
Node.js: v14 or higher
MongoDB (or any database you're using)
.env file to store environment variables securely
Installation
1. Clone the repository
bash
Kopiera kod
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
2. Install dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the required packages.

bash
Kopiera kod
cd your-repository
npm install
3. Setup .env file
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your environment variables. Example:

env
Kopiera kod
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
4. Run the application
Start the server by running:

bash
Kopiera kod
npm start
This will run the server on the port specified in .env or the default port 5000.

Routes
POST /api/login: Logs in a user.
GET /api/secret-data: Gets secret data (requires authentication).
CRUD for items: All routes under /api/items (create, read, update, delete operations for items).
Database
Make sure you update the MONGODB_URI in your .env file with your own MongoDB connection string. If you're using a different database, modify the connectDB function accordingly.

Security
CSP Headers: This application includes a basic Content Security Policy header to improve security.
Authentication: Implemented login functionality to protect certain routes.
